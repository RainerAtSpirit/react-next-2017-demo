# React-Next 2017 demo

Note: this demo relies on the EmojiOne font being installed. Supported by Firefox.

Promise rejections are not enabled in firefox by default though. Set `dom.promise_rejection_events.enabled` to true to see the react error overlay for promise rejections. ([docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/unhandledrejection))
